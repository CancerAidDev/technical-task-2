# Technical Task 2

## Introduction

The goal of this task is to get familiar with the Elm ecosystem used at CancerAid.

Your task is to set up a new backend server to interface with an elm sortable table interface.

You will be assessed based on your reasoning and how you approach the problem, not necessarily on success.

## Installation

We use `yarn` for our package management in CancerAid.

Install dependencies with `yarn install`.

The interface can be tested by running `yarn local` in the root directory of the project, along with `yarn serve` in the `example` folder (in a separate terminal).

## The Task

Your task is to create a server that serves a backend for the paginated table using a language of your choice.

An example javascript server can be found in the `example` folder - this is just to give an idea of functionality rather than being an example of good code ...
